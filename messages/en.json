  "FAQs": {
    "label": "FAQs",
    "description": "Here are some of the most frequently asked questions.",
    "question1": "What is a landing page?",
    "answer1": "A landing page is a standalone web page created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It's where a visitor 'lands' after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web. Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as a call to action (CTA).",
    "question2": "How can I create a landing page?",
    "answer2": "Creating a landing page can be done in several steps: 1) Choose a landing page template that fits your campaign's needs or start from scratch. 2) Identify your landing page's objective and CTA. 3) Write compelling content that urges visitors to take action. 4) Incorporate design elements such as images, videos, and forms that align with your message. 5) Test your page's usability and mobile responsiveness. 6) Use SEO best practices to help your page get found. 7) Publish your landing page and monitor its performance to make adjustments as needed.",
    "question3": "Why is a landing page important?",
    "answer3": "Landing pages are crucial for any marketing strategy because they provide a targeted platform for converting visitors into leads or customers. Unlike general websites, landing pages focus the visitor's attention on a single offer, minimizing distractions and guiding them toward a specific action. This focused approach can significantly increase the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns, improve your ad performance, and enhance the overall user experience by providing them with the information or solution they were seeking.",
